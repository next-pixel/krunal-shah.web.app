Are you a C# developer wondering when to use struct over class in your code? If so, you're not alone. While both structs and classes are used to define custom types in C#, they have some key differences that can affect the performance and behavior of your code.

In this article, we'll take a closer look at the differences between structs and classes, and explore when it's appropriate to use each one. We'll cover everything from performance considerations to best practices for struct and class usage, so you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to use these powerful tools in your own code.

Learn when to use struct over class in C# with this comprehensive guide. Discover the performance considerations and best practices for struct and class usage in C# development.

## Introduction

Before we dive into the details of when to use struct over class in C#, let's first define what structs and classes are, and how they differ from one another.

In C#, a struct is a value type that can contain data members and methods, similar to a class. However, unlike classes, structs are passed by value rather than by reference. This means that when you pass a struct to a method, a copy of the struct is created and passed to the method, rather than a reference to the original struct.

On the other hand, a class is a reference type that can contain data members and methods. When you pass a class to a method, you pass a reference to the original class, rather than a copy of the class.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the differences between structs and classes, let's take a closer look at when to use each one.

## When to Use Class Over Struct in C#

## Performance Considerations

One of the most significant differences between structs and classes is how they handle memory allocation. Understanding the performance implications of using structs versus classes is crucial for writing efficient C# code.

## Structs and Classes in Memory

When you declare a struct, the runtime allocates memory for the struct on the stack. This means that the memory is allocated and deallocated automatically, without any additional overhead.

Classes, on the other hand, are allocated on the heap. The heap is a managed memory space where the .NET runtime allocates memory for objects that are longer-lived than the stack-based memory of a method call.

Allocating memory on the heap requires additional overhead, as the runtime must manage memory allocation and garbage collection. This can have a performance impact, especially when dealing with large objects or frequent object allocation.

## Structs vs. Classes: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference

Another performance consideration when using structs and classes is how they are passed between methods. When you pass a struct to a method, a copy of the struct is created and passed to the method. This is known as pass by value.

Passing a class to a method, on the other hand, passes a reference to the original class. This is known as pass by reference.

Passing structs by value can be more efficient than passing classes by reference, as it avoids the overhead of managing references. However, passing large structs by value can result in increased memory usage and decreased performance.

## Best Practices for Struct Usage

When using structs in C#, there are a few best practices to keep in mind:

Keep structs small: Since structs are allocated on the stack, they should be small enough to avoid causing a stack overflow. A good rule of thumb is to keep structs under 16 bytes

Structures and classes are both used to define custom data types, but they have some significant differences. A structure is a value type, meaning that it stores its value directly in memory, whereas a class is a reference type, meaning that it stores a reference to the object in memory. Because a structure is a value type, it is more efficient in terms of memory usage and can be faster to access than a class.

Another important difference between structs and classes is that structs are typically used for small, lightweight objects, while classes are used for larger, more complex objects. This is because a structure is designed to hold a small amount of data, while a class can hold a large amount of data and can include methods and properties.

When deciding whether to use a struct or a class, it is important to consider the intended use of the object. If the object is intended to be small and lightweight, such as a point or a color, then a struct is likely the best choice. If the object is intended to be larger and more complex, such as a customer or an invoice, then a class is likely the best choice.

Another important factor to consider when deciding between a struct and a class is the intended use of the object. If the object is intended to be used as part of a larger class hierarchy, or if it needs to be used with interfaces or inheritance, then a class is likely the best choice. If the object is intended to be used in a simple, standalone way, such as a coordinate or a dimension, then a struct is likely the best choice.

In addition to these factors, there are some other considerations to keep in mind when deciding between a struct and a class. For example, if you need to create an object that is thread-safe, then a struct may be a better choice, as it is guaranteed to be immutable. On the other hand, if you need to create an object that can be updated or changed over time, then a class may be a better choice.

It is also important to consider the performance implications of using a struct versus a class. As mentioned earlier, a struct is typically more efficient in terms of memory usage and can be faster to access than a class. However, if you are working with large, complex objects, or if you are performing a lot of operations on the object, then a class may be more efficient in terms of performance.

In conclusion, choosing between a struct and a class in C# depends on a variety of factors, including the size and complexity of the object, its intended use, and its performance requirements. Structs are best used for small, lightweight objects that are used in a simple, standalone way, while classes are best used for larger, more complex objects that are part of a larger class hierarchy or that require inheritance or interfaces. By carefully considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about which type of custom data type to use in your C# code.
