## Pre-built Exceptions In .NET

If you need to throw an exception in parts of your code, take a look at these things before creating a new exception!

## TimeoutException
This exception is thrown when an operation
times out before it can complete.

You can use this exception when working with network
or database operations that have a timeout value.

## HttpException
This exception is speciﬁc to ASP.NET and is
thrown when an HTTP-related error occurs,
such as a 404 Not Found error.

You can use this exception when handling
HTTP-related errors in your web application.

## FormatException
This exception is thrown when a string
cannot be parsed into a speciﬁc data type.

You can use this exception when validating user input
or when working with strings that need to be
converted to a speciﬁc data type.

## FileNotFoundException
This exception is thrown when a ﬁle cannot
be found.

You can use this exception when working with ﬁles to
ensure that the ﬁle exists before performing
operations on it.

## SocketException
This exception is speciﬁc to network
programming and is thrown when a
network-related error occurs, such as a
connection failure.

You can use this exception when working with network
programming to handle errors that may occur.

## AggregateException
This exception is thrown when multiple
exceptions occur during the execution of a
task or operation.

You can use this exception to aggregate multiple
exceptions and handle them together.

## HttpRequestException
This exception is speciﬁc to ASP.NET Core and
is thrown when an HTTP-related error occurs,
such as a connection failure or timeout.

You can use this exception when working with HTTP
requests to handle errors that may occur.

## OperationCanceledException
This exception is thrown when an operation
is cancelled, usually due to a cancellation
token being triggered.

You can use this exception to cancel long-running
operations and gracefully exit the application.

## AccessViolationException
This exception is thrown when an attempt is
made to access memory that is not authorized.

You can use this exception when working with
low-level memory operations or when accessing
unmanaged resources.

## OutOfMemoryException
This exception is thrown when there is not
enough memory to perform an operation.

You can use this exception when working with
memory-intensive operations, such as image or video
processing.

## NotSupportedException
This exception is thrown when a method or
feature is not supported in the current context
or platform.

You can use this exception when developing
platform-speciﬁc code that may not be supported on
all platforms.

## KeyNotFoundException
This exception is thrown when a speciﬁed
key is not found in a dictionary.

You can use this exception when working with
dictionaries to ensure that a key exists before
attempting to access its value.

## ObjectDisposedException
This exception is thrown when an object has
been disposed and cannot be used anymore.

You can use this exception when working with
disposable objects to ensure that the object is still
valid before performing operations on it.

## InvalidOperationException
This exception is thrown when an operation is
not valid for the current state of an object.

You can use this exception when enforcing business
rules or ensuring that certain operations are
performed in a speciﬁc order.

## UnauthorizedAccessException
This exception is thrown when an operation is
not authorized or a user does not have
permission to perform a speciﬁc action.

You can use this exception when implementing access
control or security checks.

## IndexOutOfRangeException
This exception is thrown when an index is
outside the bounds of an array or collection.

You can use this exception when working with arrays
or collections to ensure that the index is within the
valid range.

## OverﬂowException
This exception is thrown when a value is too
large or too small to be represented by the
data type.

You can use this exception when working with
arithmetic operations that may result in an overﬂow.

## SqlException
This exception is speciﬁc to SQL Server and is
thrown when a database-related error occurs,
such as a syntax error in a SQL query.

You can use this exception when working with SQL
Server databases to handle errors that may occur.

## AuthenticationException
This exception is speciﬁc to ASP.NET Core and
is thrown when an authentication-related error
occurs, such as invalid credentials or expired
tokens.

You can use this exception to handle authentication
errors in your application.

## StackOverﬂowException
This exception is thrown when the stack
overﬂows, usually due to excessive recursion.

You can use this exception when working with
recursive algorithms to ensure that the recursion
depth does not exceed a certain limit.

## NotImplementedException
This exception is thrown when a method or
feature has not been implemented yet.

You can use this exception when you need to provide
a placeholder for future development work.

## ArgumentNullException
This exception is thrown when a null argument is
passed to a method or constructor.

You can use this exception to ensure that required
arguments are not null.

## DivideByZeroException
This exception is thrown when an attempt is
made to divide a number by zero.

You can use this exception when working with
arithmetic operations that may result in a divide by
zero error.

## ArgumentNullException
This exception is thrown when an argument
provided to a method or constructor is
invalid or out of range.

You can use this exception when validating user input
or conﬁguration settings.
