## Adapter
Convert the interface of a class to another interface that clients expect.

* interface, class, conversion

## Bridge
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

* implementation, abstraction, decoupling, independent variation

## Observer
Notify multiple objects when the state of another object changes.

* multiple objects, state change, notification

## Decorator
Add behavior to an object dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects.

* object behavior, dynamic addition, no effect on other objects

## Builder

Simplify the creation of complex objects with many optional parameters.

* complex objects, optional parameters, simplified creation

## Factory
Dynamically create objects based on input, configuration, or business rules.

* object creation, dynamic, input, configuration, business rules

## Template Method
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override specific steps.

* algorithm, skeleton, base class, specific steps, subclass

## Command
Encapsulate a request as an object and pass it to invokers to execute.

* encapsulation, request, object, invokers, execution

## Proxy
Control access to an object by creating a surrogate that handles the request.

* access control, surrogate, request handling

## Iterator
Traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying implementation.

* collection, element traversal, implementation hiding

## Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem to simplify their usage.

* simplified usage, subsystem, interface, unification

## Composite
Compose objects into a tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies.

* tree structure, part-whole hierarchy, object composition

## Flyweight
Share objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

* object sharing, fine-grained objects, efficiency

## Visitor
Separate the algorithm from the object structure it operates on.

* algorithm separation, object structure, operation

## State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.

* State change, notification
