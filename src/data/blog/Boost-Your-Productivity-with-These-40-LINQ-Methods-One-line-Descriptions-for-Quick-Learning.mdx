## Intersect

Returns the common elements between two sequences.

## Of Type

Filters a sequence to only include elements of a specified type.

## Except

Returns the elements in the first sequence that are not in the second sequence.

## Repeat
Generates a sequence that repeats a specified value a specified number of times.

## ThenBy

Performs a secondary sort on a sequence based on a key.

## ToLookup

Creates a lookup table from a sequence based on a key.

## ElementAt 

Returns the element at a specified index IN 0 sequence.

## Range

Generates a sequence of integers within a specified range.

## Distinct

Returns the unique elements in a sequence.

## Empty

Returns an empty sequence of a specified type.

## Groupdoin

Performs a left outer join on two sequences based on a key and groups the results.

## DefaultifEmpty

Returns a default value if a sequence is empty.

## Where

Filters a sequence based on a condition.

## Union

Returns the distinct elements from two

## sequences.

Select Projects each element of a sequence into a new form.

## Count

Returns the number of elements in a sequence.

## OrderBy

Sorts a sequence in ascending order based on a key.

## Concat

Concatenates two sequences.

## First

Returns the first element of a sequence.

## ElementAtOrDefault

Returns the element at a specified index in a sequence or a default value if the index is out of range.

## FirstOrDefault

Returns the first element of a sequence or a default value if the sequence is empty.

## Last

Returns the last element of a sequence.

## LastOrDefault

Returns the last element of a sequence or a default value if the sequence is empty.

## Single

Returns the only element of a sequence, or throws an exception if there is not exactly one element.

## SingleOrDefault

Returns the only element of a sequence, or a default value if the sequence is empty or if there is not exactly one element.

## Take

Returns a specified number of elements from the start of a sequence.

## TakeWhile

Returns elements from a sequence while a condition is true.

## Skip

Skips a specified number of elements in a sequence.

## SkipWhile

Skips elements in a sequence while a condition is true.

## Sum

Computes the sum of a sequence of numeric values.

## ThenByDescending

Performs a secondary sort in descending order based on a key.

## Min, Max

Returns the minimum or maximum value in a sequence of numeric values.

## ToDictionary

Creates a dictionary from a sequence of key-value pairs.

## Any

Determines whether any element of a sequence satisfies a condition.

## OrderByDescending

OrderByDescending method is used to sort the data in Descending order.

## Reverse

Reverse method is used to reverse the dota stored in a data source.

## All

Determines whether all elements of a sequence satisfy a condition.

## Average

Computes the average of a sequence of numeric values.

## Contains

Contains Method is used to check whether a sequence or collection (i.e. data source) contains a specified element or not.
